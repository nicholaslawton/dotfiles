# Central theme definition â€“ used by all applications

# The palette section defines the colour palette. Each element can support a gradient between two colours, the primary
# and secondary. Visual elements may choose to support the gradient colours, or may choose to use only the primary
# colour as a flat colour. Choosing the same value for both colours of a gradient would produce a flat colour even for
# visual elements which support a gradient.

# The predominant colour
# Usage examples: window background
dominant = { primary = "1a1a1aaa", secondary = "595959aa" }

# A contrast to the dominant colour
# Usage examples: standard text, rendered on the domainant background to be easily readable
contrast = { primary = "eeeeeeff", secondary = "eeeeeeff" }

# A sequential collection of additional colours which comprise the palette, and provide accents to the visual style.
